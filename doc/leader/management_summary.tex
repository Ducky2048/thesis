\chapter*{Management Summary}
\label{chap:managementSummary}


Today, we use a number of computing devices interchangeably on a daily basis: a desktop workstation at the office, a laptop computer
on the move, a tablet in the living room and of course, always by our side, the smartphone.
In an increasingly cloudified and mobile world our expectation is to be able to do our work all the same,
regardless of the computing device we use, or where we are.
It's difficult to meet this expectation with the way electronic signatures were created in the past,
using certificates on smartcards, plugged into a laptop, using a specialised card reader and accompanying software.
It's annoying and inconvenient, and a lot can go wrong: a random operating system update breaking driver compatibility with the card reader, for example.
In this thesis, we implement a remote signing service, allowing people to create electronic signatures no matter
where they are or what device they're using.
