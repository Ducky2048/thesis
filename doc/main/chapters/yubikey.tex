\chapter{Yubikey HSM}

In a first look at the yubikey hsm and the required packages we found that the access for the developer always happens via the yubikey-connector which provides a http server.
The protocol however is not documented and is binary. The developer always has to go through libyubihsm to connect with the server.
From this we can conclude that the intended use is to have the yubikey hsm on a device with just the connector running and nothing else and the application interfacing with the hsm on another server.
This scenario would improve security as the application doesn't have direct hardware access to the hsm.
