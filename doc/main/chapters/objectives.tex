\chapter{Objectives}
\label{ch:objectives}

Building on our work in Project 2~\cite{projekt2},
where we showed how a digital signature and an \gls{OIDC}-based authentication can be securely linked,
we will implement a Digital Signing Service.

The implementation consists of the remote signing service itself exposing a \gls{REST} \gls{API},
and a cross-platform frontend authenticating the users through a trusted \gls{OIDC} \gls{IDP}.
This frontend uses the \gls{REST} \gls{API} for signing the users' files.
On top of that, we implement offline verification of existing signatures on desktop operating systems.
For a detailed specification of the objectives, please see appendix TODO include spec doc and link here.

\section{Previous Works}
\label{section:previousworks}

We build upon our previous work of Project 2~\cite{projekt2}, where we specified the authentication process
for qualified signatures, non-qualified batch signatures, the signature file format,
as well as - to our knowledge - pioneering the secure integration of a digital signature with an \gls{OIDC} ID token without requiring any change to the \gls{IDP}.

We expand upon the previous work substantially both functionally and conceptually.
This work is not just an implementation of an existing concept.
