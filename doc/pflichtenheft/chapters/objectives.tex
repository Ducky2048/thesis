\chapter*{Objectives}
\label{ch:objectives}

The implementation consists of the remote signing service itself in the form of a \gls{REST} \gls{API},
and a cross-platform frontend authenticating the users through a trusted \gls{OIDC} \gls{IDP}.
This frontend uses the \gls{REST} \gls{API} for signing the users' files.
On top of that, it offers offline verification of existing signatures on desktop operating systems.

\section{Previous Works}
\label{section:previousworks}

We build upon our previous work of Project 2\cite{projekt2}, where we specified the authentication process
for qualified signatures, non-qualified batch signatures as well as the signature file format.

\section{Backend}
\label{section:backend}

The server is the centrepiece of the service, where the actual signatures are being created.
It depends on the \gls{IDP} for authenticating its users.

\section{Frontend}
\label{section:frontend}

The frontend must be cross-platform, where cross-platform means supporting the desktop operating systems
GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS as well as the mobile phone operating systems Google Android and Apple iOS.
The frontend must support authentication, creating signatures as well as verifying them.
Verification must be available online as well as offline, except for the mobile version, where offline verification is not required.

\section{Comparison with existing solutions}
\label{section:comparison}

The Cloud Signature Consortium standardised a remote signing service with OIDC/oAuth. Adobe has made an implementation of this standard.
The goal is to learn how this implementation works and compare it with our solution, with a focus on security.

\section{Evaluate Yubikey HSM for Signing Service}
\label{section:evaluateyubikey}

In order to provide a secure solution for the signing keys, we will evaluate the Yubikey HSM 2.
This would avoid having the signing keys on the filesystem and improve the security of our solution.
